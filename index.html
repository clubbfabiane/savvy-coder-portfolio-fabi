    Dead stare with ears cocked kitty scratches couch bad kitty climb a tree, 
    wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face so hit you unexpectedly.

    me some of your food meh, i don't want it what a cat-ass-trophy! for steal the warm 
    chair right after you get up or my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too.
